## üó∫ 16-Week Guided Roadmap

> Follow this roadmap to learn backend development effectively. Each week focuses on new tools and concepts. Stay consistent, build projects, and don‚Äôt skip the hands-on practice.

### Week 1: Introduction to Programming & Java Fundamentals
Kickstart your journey with Java basics - syntax, variables, data types, and how programming works.

### Week 2: OOP Basics, Arrays, Strings  
Master OOP foundation, arrays, and strings to build a solid foundation in object-oriented Java programming.

### Week 3: Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Interfaces  
Dive deeper into encapsulation, inheritance, and interfaces to create modular, reusable code.

### Week 4: Lambdas, Threads, Collections, and Exception Handling  
Learn lambda expressions, multi-threading, collections, and exception handling for real-world applications.

### Week 5: File I/O, Streams, Optional & Functional Programming  
Work with file handling, Java Streams, and Optionals to write clean and efficient data processing code.

### Week 6: SQL Essentials + JDBC Integration  
Understand relational databases and write SQL queries, followed by integrating them using JDBC.

### Week 7: Servlets, JSP & MVC Architecture  
Explore Servlets, JSP, and MVC architecture to understand how dynamic web applications are built.

### Week 8: Maven + Hibernate  
Set up projects with Maven and work with Hibernate ORM to map Java objects to database tables.

### Week 9: Spring Core, Spring Boot, and Dependency Injection  
Get started with Spring Core and Spring Boot to build modern, scalable Java applications.

### Week 10: Spring JDBC + Spring Web MVC  
Connect databases using Spring JDBC and build structured web apps using Spring Web MVC.

### Week 11: RESTful APIs with Spring Boot  
Create RESTful APIs with Spring Boot and learn to build backend services for real-world applications.

### Week 12: Spring Data JPA + ORM Best Practices  
Manage persistent data using Spring Data JPA and best ORM practices for cleaner, maintainable code.

### Week 13: AOP & Spring Security (JWT + OAuth Basics)  
Secure your applications using Spring Security (JWT + OAuth) and apply AOP for cross-cutting concerns.

### Week 14: Build Intelligent Apps with Spring AI  
Learn to integrate AI capabilities into your Spring Boot applications using Spring AI.

### Week 15: Microservices Essentials + Cloud Deployment  
Understand microservices architecture and deploy backend apps to the cloud.

### Week 16: Logging (Log4J), Docker, Jenkins Basics + Final Mentorship  
Learn to containerize your apps with Docker, implement logging with Log4J for maintainability, and wrap up your learning with final guidance and job-prep.

## üß© How to Use This Roadmap

1. **Follow the Weeks in Order**  
   Don't rush through topics. Java fundamentals are essential before diving into Spring Boot.

2. **Code Every Day**  
   Spend time coding, not just watching tutorials. Build small projects weekly.

3. **Document What You Learn**  
   Maintain a GitHub repo or blog summarizing each week's learnings.

4. **Build Real Projects**  
   Don't just follow tutorials. Apply concepts in personal or open-source projects.

5. **Practice Debugging & Testing**  
   Use tools like JUnit5. Learn to debug your code early.

6. **Use Git & GitHub**  
   Version control is a must. Start using Git from Week 1.

7. **Deploy Your Applications**  
   Learn to deploy apps to the cloud (Heroku, Render, AWS). Dockerize them where needed.

8. **Network and Get Feedback**  
   Share progress on LinkedIn, GitHub, or dev communities. Peer feedback improves your skills.

9. **Repeat & Reinforce**  
   Revisit difficult topics. Refactor old projects using new knowledge.

10. **Stay Consistent**  
   16 weeks is manageable if you commit ~10‚Äì12 hours weekly. The key is consistency.
